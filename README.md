## 🤔 What is UNO?

UNO is the classic and beloved card game that’s easy to pick up and impossible to put down! Players take turns matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck either by color or number. Special action cards deliver game-changing moments as they each perform a function to help you defeat your opponents. These include Skips, reverses, draw twos, color-changing wild and draw four wild cards.
